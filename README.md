# MNIST-Classifier

I have implemented a Neural Network for classification numbers using PyTorch. The layers use LeakyReLU + Softmax at the and. For efficiency and better results, I have made use of Glorot Initialization of the weights, 0 initialization of the biases, BatchNorm, Dropout, Shuffling, Minibatching and RMSProp.

The CNN version uses the same strategy for efficiency and better results and the architecture of Yann Lecun's LeNet-5 (see below).
